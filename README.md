# Vocabulary.com list manager

Vocabulary.com is the most popular vocabulary trainer on the internet among learners of the English language and logophiles alike. Learners can create and curate lists of words to learn on their account. However, when lists become lengthy there are two challenges: it is not easy to tell whether one has already included a word in one of their lists and one desires a more randomized practice routine than the order in which they input the words. This python script offers a solution to both challenges.
